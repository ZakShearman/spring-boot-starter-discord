## Zak's Spring Boot Starter Discord

## Features

  - Automatic JDA instance creation based off your config value (`spring.discord` in your application.yaml)
  - Integration with Spring's event system, e.g `@EventListener(MessageReceivedEvent.class)`
  - Slash command system (`@DiscordCommand`, `@DiscordSubCommand`)

This project is in no sense official and only exists since I don't see a use keeping it private. Enjoy :)

Documentation: The documentation is the code or me, sorry.
Support: Make an issue <3
